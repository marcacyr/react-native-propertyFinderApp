# Property Finder App in React Native
Diving into React Native - time to take it for a spin!

This is from the Ray Wenderlich Tutorial on React Native, which can be found here:
http://www.raywenderlich.com/99473/introducing-react-native-building-apps-javascript

The tutorial is pretty good... but has some issues. There seem to be some problems on the API's end that the tutorial uses - so you may run into a "Network Request Failed" error. 

I debugged this for awhile and could find nothing wrong in the code - it seems to be on the API's side of things. 

So... this code ends partway through the tutorial. Partly because of the error, and partly because for my own use I just needed to see some things in action to get an idea of what to do since I already work with React regularly.

May come back and finish this code when the API is fixed.
